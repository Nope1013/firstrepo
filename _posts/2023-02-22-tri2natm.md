# Trimester 2 N@TM Blog

### Night @ The Museum !!

Our group was pleased with the way that our program was functioning, and looked forward to demonstrating it to an audience. We also showcased our individual features.

We were lucky to have some parents who were interested in our program and they remarked that it was user friendly. The appearance was enjoyed as well. I could definitely improve the Functionality of the program to have it represent my original idea. I want to add a table as well, likely a form, where users can input materials.

Several classmates and students from other classes tried out our project.

We also visited Mr Mort's period 3 class to see their projects.

I decided to look at the performing and visual arts that were present as well. I revisited the AP Studio Art classroom and was pleasantly surprised to see one of my old pieces. I also looked at digital media, 3-D animation, ceramics, and jazz band.

Overall, N@TM was quite successful and I was glad that we had such a cohesive team. Over break I want to implement the changes I mentioned earlier, and add a table where users can input whether or not they liked their recipe. I will have it store data similar to the local storage button I included.
