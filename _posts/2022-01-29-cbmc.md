Incorrect Answer: B

Correction: c, Messages are broken into packets, but they can be received in any order and still be reassembled. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, as well as metadata for routing and reassembling the data upon receipt. This allows the packets to be received in any order and still be reassembled correctly.

### Q22
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2q22.png)

Incorrect Answer: B

Correction: C, This code incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged $7 for each of the first 25 units and $5 for each subsequent unit. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer 25 * $7 + 7 * $5 = $210 for the 32 units. If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174.

### Q30
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2q30.png)

Incorrect Answer: A,C

Correction: B,C, This code segment assigns "yarn" to word1, "zebra" to word2, and "xylophone" to word3. The first statement assigns the value of word1 to the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of word3 to word1. The third statement assigns the original value of word1, which is stored in temp, to word3. The original values of word1 and word3 are interchanged, which reverses the values of the variables as intended.

Incorrect Answer: B

Correction: C, Incorrect. While the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers. List indices are typically nonnegative integers. The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. So, 4 would be considered a valid index.
