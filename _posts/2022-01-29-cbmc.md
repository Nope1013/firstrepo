### Q11
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2q11.png)

Incorrect Answer: C

Correction: A, If input B is false, the resulting value coming out of the OR gate will be true (since the value of A is true). Since the value of C is true, the resulting value coming out of the AND gate is true. This result contradicts the statement. Because the value of input A is true, the resulting value coming out of the OR gate must be true. Because the value of input C is true, the resulting value coming out of the AND gate is true. The value of input B did not affect this result.

Incorrect Answer: B

Correction: C, I understand this problem, I just needed to read it more thoroughly. I did not read that the turn function was only to turn right, thus the robot needs to make many more right turns to make a left turn instead of a singular turn which I had interpreted it to be.
