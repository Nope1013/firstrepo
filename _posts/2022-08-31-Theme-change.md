I noticed that my pages had gone missing, and when I changed it back, the same issue prevailed. After checking with my pair, tablemates, and finally Mr. Mortensen, I realized the error after changing it back was misspelling "minima" as "mimima." Embarrassing. I learned how to find comment history, however.
