![fresh2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fresh2.png)

- **Backend**: Will require the “MyCookbook.io” API to select recipes that correspond with the chosen ingredients


## Video Plan
- Will run the program by checking off some ingredients
- Clicking the "enter" button
- Should spit out recipes that include the ingredients selected
- The link to the recipe will go to an outside source
