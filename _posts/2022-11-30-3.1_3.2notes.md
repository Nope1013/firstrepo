# Unit 3 Sections 1-2 Notes

### Variables and Assignments Key Ideas (3.1)

- Variables are abstractions within programs which represent a value
- Values can be individual data points or a list/collection that contains many data values
- Types of data can include numbers, Booleans (true or false), lists, and strings

### Data Abstraction Key Ideas (3.2)

- A list is made up of elements organized in a specific order
- An element is a unique, individual value in a list
- A string differs from a list as it is a sequence of characters rather than elements
- Data abstraction uses a list by taking specific data elements from a list and organizing into a whole, less complex representation of the values such as a table

### Python

- To define a variable in Python, type in the variable name (one word) and use the = sign to set it equal to its value
- Can be defined using numbers, string, list, or boolean
- Strings must have quotations "" around it and lists must be surrounded by square brackets []
- THe variable can now be used in functions such as print('')
- A dictionary can be created with keys and values in curly brackets {}
- Variables can be interchanged with temporary variables (temp function)
- They can also be defined with float data type which is used the same as integer
