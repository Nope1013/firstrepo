Incorrect Answer: B

Correction: C, Floating-point numbers are represented differently from integers. The limitations of floating-point numbers typically result in round-off errors, not overflow errors. Overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.

Incorrect Answer: A

Correction: C, With the inputs from A, the OR gate will produce an output of true and the first AND gate will produce an output of false. Since only one input to the second AND gate will be true, the circuit will have an output of false. With the inputs from C, the OR gate will produce an output of true and the first AND gate will produce an output of true. Since both inputs to the second AND gate will be true, the circuit will have an output of true.

Q17

Incorrect Answer: B

Correction: D, The loop begins at the end of the list and moves to the start of the list, so index should be decremented, not incremented. The program traverses wordList starting at the end of the list and moving to the start of the list, removing any elements that are equal to "the" or "a" along the way. Inserting this statement between lines 7 and 8 decrements index after checking each list element, ensuring that all elements are checked.

Q32

Incorrect Answer: B

Correction: A, Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB, not 100 GB. The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB.

Incorrect Answer: A

Correction: B, IPv6 addresses are longer than IPv4 addresses. The length of the address has no direct effect on routing speed. IPv6 allows for a greater number of IP addresses than IPv4 does, which allows more devices to be connected.

Q50

Incorrect Answer: C

Correction: D, Algorithm III accesses 10 elements, which is considered reasonable time. For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function. Algorithm I accesses elements 2n times (twice for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm II accesses 2n elements (n times for each of n elements), which is considered reasonable time. Algorithm III accesses 10 elements, which is considered reasonable time.

Incorrect Answer: B and C

Correction: B and A, Since x OR y evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x is true, true is displayed. Since x OR y evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x AND y evaluates to false, false is displayed. Since x is true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x OR y evaluates to true, true is displayed.
