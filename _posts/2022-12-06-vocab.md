# Unit 3 Vocab

Variables
- Represent a value
- Include Boolean, string, lists, numbers, etc
- Data types
Assignment Operators
- x = value
- x is a variable
- assigning value to a variable

### Managing Complexity with Variables

Lists and Dictionaries
- can be split or joines
- lists are square brackets
- dictionaries are curly brackets
Data Abstraction
- provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation
Algorithms
- sequences
- carry out functions
Concatenation
- combining two strings
Substring
- characters part of a string
Pseudocode
- can describe what the code will do without writing the code
- indexes start at 1, not 0
- Helps see what program does without having to write it out
Iteration
- repetition
Expressions
Boolean
- true/ false
- in binary, 0 is false and 1 is true
Boolean Operators
- produce booleans after used between 2 values
Relational Operators
- work between two values of the same type (operators)
- "==, !=, >, <, >=, <="
Conditional
- Executing different statements based on the result of a true or false statement (booleans)
Selection
- The process that determines which parts of an algorithm is being executed based on a condition that is true or false.

### Python If, Elif, Else conditionals 

Determine what follows after a program, otherwise they continue
Nested Selection Statements
- essentially loops within loops
For loops, while loops, and recursive loops
- Combining loops with conditionals can allow them to either break or continue
- Ex: if x = 3, break loop
