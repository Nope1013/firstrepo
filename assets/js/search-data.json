            "content": "What are procedures? . Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values . Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality . Procedural Abstraction: allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: methods or functions, it all depends on the language . Why are procedures effective?: allows for the changing of code without altering the program calls, making it much easier and more efficient than reading line-by-line . Additional Notes . Procedure calls interrupt a series of statements so the program executes the statements in the procedure | After it is complete, it returns to the original statements to finish them | It is necessary to examine the code line by line to confirm a procedure | A procedure MAY or MAY NOT return a number or boolean | To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | . Questions to ask when developing a procedure . What am I going to name my procedure? (It should reflect the purpose of the code) | What parameters do I need? | What data would I need to take in to accomplish my goal? | Do I want my procedure to give a numerical value, or complete an action? | . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): binary = &quot;&quot; while int(n) &gt; 0: binary+=str(int(n%2)) n = n / 2 print(binary[::-1]) # how to reverse string n = int(input(&#39;Enter the decimal integer of choice&#39;)) convertToBinary(n) # I entered 7 . 111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript may get you extra) . // my javascript kernel is broken and has never worked, but I did the challenge in js anyways, it just won&#39;t run function findmax(numA,numB) { if (numA &gt; numB) { return numA; } else { return numB; } } function findmin(numA, numB) { if (numA &lt; numB) { return numA; } else { return numB } } console.log(findmax(1, 10)); console.log(findmin(1, 10)); . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options. The first hack is for a 0.7 + extra work for the full 1. Simply create your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do a LOT additional work to get a 1. For the other option, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. If this is completed along with extra work, you can get a 1. . def convertToBinary(n): if n &gt;= 1: convertToBinary(n // 2) print(n % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) def bin(word): list = [] for character in str(word): list.append(character) for item in list: index = list.index(item) unicode = ord(item) # ord function returns the unicode for a character list[index] = unicode for i in list: x = list.index(i) new = convertToBinary(i) list[int(x)] = unicode word = input(&quot;enter word&quot;) print(word, &quot; converted to binary is &quot;) bin(word) . apcsp converted to binary is 0110000101110000011000110111001101110000 .",

            "title": "Pope On Demand",
            "content": "Noor Grewal . DaFoe . APEL . 19 January 2022 . Pope On-Demand . Making mistakes is a fundamental part of the human experience. Everybody has made a mistake, whether consequential or insignificant, at some point in their life. Thus, making mistakes is easy, but forgiving those mistakes often is not. Alexander Pope, in his long poem An Essay on Criticism, wrote that making mistakes is human, however forgiving those mistakes is “divine.” Forgiveness does not usually come easy, and is seen by Pope as something holy, something that should not be taken for granted, because it is a second chance. This can be a shot at redemption for the errors that every person makes, but it can also result in horrible consequences when gifted to the wrong person. While I agree with Pope that the divinity of forgiveness for human mistakes can lead to progression when those people who have erred want to contribute to society, some people who make mistakes are beyond saving, and giving them a second chance can have ruinous consequences. . Primarily, second chances can allow people who have a purpose to help society to redeem themselves after making mistakes, and continue to serve society in a beneficial way. Many popular musicians and influencers have been subject to the phenomenon of “cancel culture,” in which their past or present mistakes are exposed to the media world, and their content is essentially boycotted. Examples include artists such as Billie Eilish, Doja Cat, and Lil Nas X, all of whom have been put in the spotlight on social media platforms for harmful or insensitive tweets. These people have made human mistakes like misreading situations or bringing down other people via the internet in their youth, and were given a second chance due to the reach of the music that they make. People are polarized on these issues, therefore some granted the artists the second chance to continue making their music, and all have progressed since then. Billie Eilish has millions of streamers who are touched by her emotional content, and able to relate to her, despite the fact that she has offended people in the past. She was given a second chance. Doja Cat is celebrated for her stage presence and empowering music, despite the fact that she has tweeted slurs in the past. She was given a second chance. Lil Nas X is one of the most popular rappers at the moment, and brings awareness to LGBT rights, despite the fact that he has attacked people online in the past. He was given a second chance. All of these artists made mistakes, were forgiven, and now serve society in positive ways today. Additionally, second chances can serve society by bringing closure to the families of victims of previously unsolved crimes. In many cold cases from before forensic technologies, the Los Angeles Police Department was prone to making mistakes in identifying the victims and perpetrators of vicious murders, taking days to find enough evidence to compile a case. Those days soon became weeks, which became months, which became years, which led to boxes and boxes of cold cases, or unsolved murders. However, when forensic technology was invented, the LAPD was given a second chance at the cases that had physical evidence, and cold cases from decades ago are still being solved today. This is an example of an entire section of our society, the police department, that was given a second chance through science, and which is thus able to serve society better, making less of the mistakes it did in the past. Even influential historical figures such as presidents have made terrible mistakes. George Washington, the first president of the United States, led his troops into a massacre when he gained commanding status. Despite this tragic mistake, he was given a second chance in the American Revolution, and was able to help the country gain independence from British tyranny. This was beneficial because even though his mistake cost lives, Washington the fact that he had made one, and that he was not a deliberate murderer. He had the goal to liberate his country from oppression, and to benefit society, so when he was forgiven, he carried out that original goal without making the same mistake. Second chances, when given to people who want to help society progress, can be extremely beneficial, because these people have the mindset to create positive change. . However, some people do not acknowledge the mistakes that they have made, and should not deserve a second chance because they will simply make those mistakes again. There are thousands of plots of books, movies, and television shows where the hero gives the villain a second chance, only to be double-crossed or to see them make the same “mistake.” A prominent example is in the Marvel show Daredevil, where the main character is a lawyer named Matt Murdock by day, and a crime-fighting vigilante named “Daredevil” by night. His main enemy is Wilson Fisk, a man who controls almost all of New York through corruption and terror. Fisk goes against Murdock in the law world and the crime world, and makes the mistakes of killing people close to him. When Murdock finally is able to get the upper hand on Fisk, he spares him instead of killing him, offering him forgiveness and a second chance at living a more honest life. Murdock, like Pope, acknowledges that humans make mistakes and that forgiveness is divine. The problem, however, is that Fisk is an example of a person who believes that his mistakes are acceptable actions, and who does not view murder and corruption as bad if it is benefitting him. As a result, Murdock’s forgiveness enables Fisk to escape prison and continue to corrupt and kill innocent people. When somebody does not wish to benefit society, their mistakes are often unforgivable, as giving them a second chance will only let them make more of these mistakes. Hypothetically, if a rapist was caught, tried, and arrested for their crime, they might serve their time, be on parole, and eventually be offered a second chance at living a morally better life and preventing their mistakes from happening again. If they realized the gravity of their actions and how they were harmful, giving them a second chance could be beneficial, as they may want to prevent others from doing what they did, bettering society. On the other hand, in a situation such as the tragic San Diego murders of Amber Dubois and Chelsea King, if the perpetrator does not believe that their actions are wrong, a second chance is just ruinous. Amber Dubois and Chelsea King were subject to the horrible actions of the same man, and he stated on record (after he was finally caught) that he would have simply kept committing atrocities if he was released from prison. He was an example of someone who should not be granted a second chance, as he sought to hurt society and innocent people, not to better it. When a person has a destructive motive or purpose in life, a second chance will allow them to continue fulfilling that purpose and making the same mistakes. . Forgiveness in the form of a second chance is therefore worth granting when the person who has erred is aware of their mistakes, and wants to redeem themselves by helping society progress positively. It is not worth granting to those who have ignoble motives and who do not treat their mistakes as such, because the historical outcome is that they continue to make them, hurting society and its people. While making mistakes is human, forgiving somebody is divine, and forgiveness should thus be granted in the correct situations and treated as something holy. .",

Given absolute freedom, I would like to code a site where users looking to adopt a pet would select a local animal shelter and input information about their household, experience, and capabilities with pets. It would be organized as a survey and also ask questions to gauge what animal they are looking for and how capable they are of caring for it. The input would then be analyzed and matched to a pet at a shelter that would be compatible with the owner. I have 3 dogs and 2 cats, all of which were rescues and took a while for us to find. Though a match is not guaranteed, this would greatly expedite the adoption process by suggesting which animals a potential adopter should meet with, as they would then have a greater chance of finding a match. . “What would motivate you to be productive each day given the freedom to code what you want?” . Given that sort of freedom, I would be motivated by the knowledge that I would be helping both shelter pets and the people who want to adopt them. Additionally, as a new coder, everything is still really exciting, so I doubt I would be easily bored, and boredom can greatly lower motivation. . “How would you measure success in your team?” . I would measure success based on communication. I would rather have a team that is behind schedule and inconsistent but that communicates that, rather than a team that has everything done but never talked about it. . “How will you maintain motivation?” . I will maintain team and personal motivation by setting small, achievable goals and keeping the big idea in mind. A success at the end of each week or so by getting to check off a goal will help keep up motivation to continue doing so each week. Additionally, small goals can often take away from the big picture, so going back and seeing the overall progress and how it has affected the project would also be motivational. . “Why is the information in this blog important?” . The information in this blog is important because it reminds us of why collaboration is critical for a successful team and project. Team members who work together will be far better off than ones who do not, and will all be able to understand the function and purpose of their project. It is also important because we have our performance task coming up, and this information will be most relevant when it is essential for us to work together. . “Would you rather work on PBL projects, or do assigned free-response coding questions (aka FRQs)? Which would be easier to meet class standards?” . Though FRQs seem like an easier way to meet class standards, I don’t believe they are as enjoyable or enriching as PBL projects. I would rather work on PBL projects because they allow newer coders to learn and for experienced coders to build upon what they know. They also revolve around projects so that we would have central goals and learning objectives to implement our new coding skills into. . “Trust and Freedom are often earned. How will you show your passion and ability to succeed in your work?” . I will show my passion and ability to succeed through completing the weekly goals I set for myself and the team, and ensuring that I try my best. Overall, if I end up with something I am proud of, that is the best measure of success. . “What key learnings and focuses are a priority for you?” . Some key learning that are a priority are encouraging team collaboration, and ensuring that lessons are absorbed. Regarding our team, it is a priority for me that we continue to communicate, work together, and report to each other as often as possible to build a strong project. For myself, I want to make sure that I will remember what I learn, which will include taking notes and updating my site with useful information. .",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Given absolute freedom, I would like to code a site where users looking to adopt a pet would select a local animal shelter and input information about their household, experience, and capabilities with pets. It would be organized as a survey and also ask questions to gauge what animal they are looking for and how capable they are of caring for it. The input would then be analyzed and matched to a pet at a shelter that would be compatible with the owner. I have 3 dogs and 2 cats, all of which were rescues and took a while for us to find. Though a match is not guaranteed, this would greatly expedite the adoption process by suggesting which animals a potential adopter should meet with, as they would then have a greater chance of finding a match. . “What would motivate you to be productive each day given the freedom to code what you want?” . Given that sort of freedom, I would be motivated by the knowledge that I would be helping both shelter pets and the people who want to adopt them. Additionally, as a new coder, everything is still really exciting, so I doubt I would be easily bored, and boredom can greatly lower motivation. . “How would you measure success in your team?” . I would measure success based on communication. I would rather have a team that is behind schedule and inconsistent but that communicates that, rather than a team that has everything done but never talked about it. . “How will you maintain motivation?” . I will maintain team and personal motivation by setting small, achievable goals and keeping the big idea in mind. A success at the end of each week or so by getting to check off a goal will help keep up motivation to continue doing so each week. Additionally, small goals can often take away from the big picture, so going back and seeing the overall progress and how it has affected the project would also be motivational. . “Why is the information in this blog important?” . The information in this blog is important because it reminds us of why collaboration is critical for a successful team and project. Team members who work together will be far better off than ones who do not, and will all be able to understand the function and purpose of their project. It is also important because we have our performance task coming up, and this information will be most relevant when it is essential for us to work together. . “Would you rather work on PBL projects, or do assigned free-response coding questions (aka FRQs)? Which would be easier to meet class standards?” . Though FRQs seem like an easier way to meet class standards, I don’t believe they are as enjoyable or enriching as PBL projects. I would rather work on PBL projects because they allow newer coders to learn and for experienced coders to build upon what they know. They also revolve around projects so that we would have central goals and learning objectives to implement our new coding skills into. . “Trust and Freedom are often earned. How will you show your passion and ability to succeed in your work?” . I will show my passion and ability to succeed through completing the weekly goals I set for myself and the team, and ensuring that I try my best. Overall, if I end up with something I am proud of, that is the best measure of success. . “What key learnings and focuses are a priority for you?” . Some key learning that are a priority are encouraging team collaboration, and ensuring that lessons are absorbed. Regarding our team, it is a priority for me that we continue to communicate, work together, and report to each other as often as possible to build a strong project. For myself, I want to make sure that I will remember what I learn, which will include taking notes and updating my site with useful information. .",

Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality . Procedural Abstraction: allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: methods or functions, it all depends on the language . Why are procedures effective?: allows for the changing of code without altering the program calls, making it much easier and more efficient than reading line-by-line . Additional Notes . Procedure calls interrupt a series of statements so the program executes the statements in the procedure | After it is complete, it returns to the original statements to finish them | It is necessary to examine the code line by line to confirm a procedure | A procedure MAY or MAY NOT return a number or boolean | To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | . Questions to ask when developing a procedure . What am I going to name my procedure?

Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): binary = &quot;&quot; while int(n) &gt; 0: binary+=str(int(n%2)) n = n / 2 print(binary[::-1]) # how to reverse string n = int(input(&#39;Enter the decimal integer of choice&#39;)) convertToBinary(n) # I entered 7 . 111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript may get you extra) . // my javascript kernel is broken and has never worked, but I did the challenge in js anyways, it just won&#39;t run function findmax(numA,numB) { if (numA &gt; numB) { return numA; } else { return numB; } } function findmin(numA, numB) { if (numA &lt; numB) { return numA; } else { return numB } } console.log(findmax(1, 10)); console.log(findmin(1, 10)); . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options. The first hack is for a 0.7 + extra work for the full 1. Simply create your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do a LOT additional work to get a 1. For the other option, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. If this is completed along with extra work, you can get a 1. . def convertToBinary(n): if n &gt;= 1: convertToBinary(n // 2) print(n % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) def bin(word): list = [] for character in str(word): list.append(character) for item in list: index = list.index(item) unicode = ord(item) # ord function returns the unicode for a character list[index] = unicode for i in list: x = list.index(i) new = convertToBinary(i) list[int(x)] = unicode word = input(&quot;enter word&quot;) print(word, &quot; converted to binary is &quot;) bin(word) . apcsp converted to binary is 0110000101110000011000110111001101110000 .",

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . _ allow a python user to import __ from a _, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with __ on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick __ _. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the __ methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called __. We will learn different ways to __ in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single ___ from the package. We can do that with the word , followed by the package name, then the word _, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use ___. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word __, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import random as r from random import * randint(0,100) . 2 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python __ library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a __ __ to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | __ | . __ | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | __ | . __ | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y | . lcm(x,y) | __ | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between .

            "title": "Searching Introduction",
            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Conditionals vs Booleans . Conditionals and booleans can be equivalent. . For example, let&#39;s say there are two booleans: rainy and sunny. . Let&#39;s look at the following code: . sunny = true; // boolean is the true or false function rainy = false; // I cannot run anything in javascript because there was a kernel error that nobody (teachers included) could resolve . if (sunny) { umbrella = false; } else if (rainy) { umbrella = true; } else { umbrella = false; } console.log(umbrella); . false .

To determine if two conditionals and booleans are the same, you can substitute the four possibilities that the two booleans (sunny and rainy) can be (listed below) into the conditional and boolean and see if both cases match: . sunny = true, rainy = true . sunny = true, rainy = false . sunny = false, rainy = true . sunny = false, rainy = false . Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 . Convert the result back to decimal: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 -&gt; 192.168.0.0 | The network address is 192.168.0.0 .",

Correction: A, Messages are broken into packets, but they can be received in any order and still be reassembled. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, as well as metadata for routing and reassembling the data upon receipt. This allows the packets to be received in any order and still be reassembled correctly. . Topics to watch videos on: 4.1, skill 5A . Q21 . Incorrect Answer: C . Correction: D, Statement I is true because strings of characters can be represented by sequences of bits. All digital data is represented at the lowest level as sequences of bits. Statement I is true because strings of characters can be represented by sequences of bits. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits.

Correction: C, Binary 1111 is equivalent to 23+22+21+20, or decimal 15. Binary 0011 is equivalent to 21+20, or decimal 3. Binary 0110 is equivalent to 22+21, or decimal 6. Binary 1111 is equivalent to 23+22+21+20, or decimal 15. Decimal 9 is not equivalent to any of the given binary numbers. . Topics to watch videos on: 2.1, skill 2B . Q28 . Incorrect Answer: D . Correction: C, This code incorrectly charges customers who use more than 25 units of electricity. These customers are charged $7 for each of the first 25 units and $5 for each subsequent unit. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. This code segment would incorrectly charge the customer 25 * $7 + 7 * $5 = $210 for the 32 units. If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. . Topics to watch videos on: 3.6, skill 2B . Q38 . Incorrect Answer: C . Correction: B, This code segment assigns “yarn” to word1, “zebra” to word2, and “xylophone” to word3. The first statement assigns the value of word1 to the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of word3 to word1. The third statement assigns the original value of word1, which is stored in temp, to word3. The original values of word1 and word3 are interchanged, which reverses the values of the variables as intended. . Topics to watch videos on: 3.3, skill 2B . Q39 . Incorrect Answer: B . Correction: C, Incorrect. While the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers. List indices are typically nonnegative integers. The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. So, 4 would be considered a valid index. .

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs.

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function.

Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function.

Variables all have a type: Strings, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner Noor Grewal Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 27 Cars: Mazda cX9 .

            "title": "Pope On Demand",
            "content": "Noor Grewal . DaFoe . APEL . 19 January 2022 . Pope On-Demand . Making mistakes is a fundamental part of the human experience. Everybody has made a mistake, whether consequential or insignificant, at some point in their life. Thus, making mistakes is easy, but forgiving those mistakes often is not. Alexander Pope, in his long poem An Essay on Criticism, wrote that making mistakes is human, however forgiving those mistakes is “divine.” Forgiveness does not usually come easy, and is seen by Pope as something holy, something that should not be taken for granted, because it is a second chance. This can be a shot at redemption for the errors that every person makes, but it can also result in horrible consequences when gifted to the wrong person. While I agree with Pope that the divinity of forgiveness for human mistakes can lead to progression when those people who have erred want to contribute to society, some people who make mistakes are beyond saving, and giving them a second chance can have ruinous consequences. . Primarily, second chances can allow people who have a purpose to help society to redeem themselves after making mistakes, and continue to serve society in a beneficial way. Many popular musicians and influencers have been subject to the phenomenon of “cancel culture,” in which their past or present mistakes are exposed to the media world, and their content is essentially boycotted. Examples include artists such as Billie Eilish, Doja Cat, and Lil Nas X, all of whom have been put in the spotlight on social media platforms for harmful or insensitive tweets. These people have made human mistakes like misreading situations or bringing down other people via the internet in their youth, and were given a second chance due to the reach of the music that they make. People are polarized on these issues, therefore some granted the artists the second chance to continue making their music, and all have progressed since then. Billie Eilish has millions of streamers who are touched by her emotional content, and able to relate to her, despite the fact that she has offended people in the past. She was given a second chance. Doja Cat is celebrated for her stage presence and empowering music, despite the fact that she has tweeted slurs in the past. She was given a second chance. Lil Nas X is one of the most popular rappers at the moment, and brings awareness to LGBT rights, despite the fact that he has attacked people online in the past. He was given a second chance. All of these artists made mistakes, were forgiven, and now serve society in positive ways today. Additionally, second chances can serve society by bringing closure to the families of victims of previously unsolved crimes. In many cold cases from before forensic technologies, the Los Angeles Police Department was prone to making mistakes in identifying the victims and perpetrators of vicious murders, taking days to find enough evidence to compile a case. Those days soon became weeks, which became months, which became years, which led to boxes and boxes of cold cases, or unsolved murders. However, when forensic technology was invented, the LAPD was given a second chance at the cases that had physical evidence, and cold cases from decades ago are still being solved today. This is an example of an entire section of our society, the police department, that was given a second chance through science, and which is thus able to serve society better, making less of the mistakes it did in the past. Even influential historical figures such as presidents have made terrible mistakes. George Washington, the first president of the United States, led his troops into a massacre when he gained commanding status. Despite this tragic mistake, he was given a second chance in the American Revolution, and was able to help the country gain independence from British tyranny. This was beneficial because even though his mistake cost lives, Washington the fact that he had made one, and that he was not a deliberate murderer. He had the goal to liberate his country from oppression, and to benefit society, so when he was forgiven, he carried out that original goal without making the same mistake. Second chances, when given to people who want to help society progress, can be extremely beneficial, because these people have the mindset to create positive change. . However, some people do not acknowledge the mistakes that they have made, and should not deserve a second chance because they will simply make those mistakes again. There are thousands of plots of books, movies, and television shows where the hero gives the villain a second chance, only to be double-crossed or to see them make the same “mistake.” A prominent example is in the Marvel show Daredevil, where the main character is a lawyer named Matt Murdock by day, and a crime-fighting vigilante named “Daredevil” by night. His main enemy is Wilson Fisk, a man who controls almost all of New York through corruption and terror. Fisk goes against Murdock in the law world and the crime world, and makes the mistakes of killing people close to him. When Murdock finally is able to get the upper hand on Fisk, he spares him instead of killing him, offering him forgiveness and a second chance at living a more honest life. Murdock, like Pope, acknowledges that humans make mistakes and that forgiveness is divine. The problem, however, is that Fisk is an example of a person who believes that his mistakes are acceptable actions, and who does not view murder and corruption as bad if it is benefitting him. As a result, Murdock’s forgiveness enables Fisk to escape prison and continue to corrupt and kill innocent people. When somebody does not wish to benefit society, their mistakes are often unforgivable, as giving them a second chance will only let them make more of these mistakes. Hypothetically, if a rapist was caught, tried, and arrested for their crime, they might serve their time, be on parole, and eventually be offered a second chance at living a morally better life and preventing their mistakes from happening again. If they realized the gravity of their actions and how they were harmful, giving them a second chance could be beneficial, as they may want to prevent others from doing what they did, bettering society. On the other hand, in a situation such as the tragic San Diego murders of Amber Dubois and Chelsea King, if the perpetrator does not believe that their actions are wrong, a second chance is just ruinous. Amber Dubois and Chelsea King were subject to the horrible actions of the same man, and he stated on record (after he was finally caught) that he would have simply kept committing atrocities if he was released from prison. He was an example of someone who should not be granted a second chance, as he sought to hurt society and innocent people, not to better it. When a person has a destructive motive or purpose in life, a second chance will allow them to continue fulfilling that purpose and making the same mistakes. . Forgiveness in the form of a second chance is therefore worth granting when the person who has erred is aware of their mistakes, and wants to redeem themselves by helping society progress positively. It is not worth granting to those who have ignoble motives and who do not treat their mistakes as such, because the historical outcome is that they continue to make them, hurting society and its people. While making mistakes is human, forgiving somebody is divine, and forgiveness should thus be granted in the correct situations and treated as something holy. .",
