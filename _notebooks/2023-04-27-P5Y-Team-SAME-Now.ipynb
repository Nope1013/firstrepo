This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application's performance.\n",

    "For example, by storing a user's name and profile picture, the application can address the user by name and display their picture, creating a more personal experience. Activity logs can also be used to track user behavior and help the application recommend new features or improvements.\n",

If there are any records, the code iterates through each record and prints out the name, field of expertise, rating, and reviews for each coding professor. If there are no records in the table, a message indicating so is printed. "
