    "## <mark>Homework/Hacks</mark>: For the hw, you have two options. The first hack is for a 0.7 + extra work for the full 1. Simply create your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do a LOT additional work to get a 1. For the other option, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate \"APCSP\" into binary. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. If this is completed along with extra work, you can get a 1. "
