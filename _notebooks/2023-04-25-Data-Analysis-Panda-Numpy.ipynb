    "Predictive analysis is the use of _________, data mining, and machine learning techniques to analyze current and historical data in order to make predictions about future events or behaviors. It involves identifying ________ and trends in data, and then using that information to forecast what is likely to happen in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analysis is used in a wide range of applications, from forecasting sales and demand, to predicting customer behavior, to detecting fraudulent transactions. It involves collecting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including historical data, customer data, financial data, and social media data, among others.\n",

    "The process of predictive analysis typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. Defining the problem and identifying the relevant data sources\n",
    "2. ______________________\n",
    "3. Exploring and analyzing the data to identify patterns and trends\n",
    "4. Selecting an appropriate model or algorithm to use for predictions\n",
    "5. Training and validating the model using historical data\n",
    "6. ______________________\n",
    "7. Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the model over time\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analysis can help organizations make more informed decisions, improve efficiency, and gain a competitive advantage by leveraging insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is most commonly used in __________, where workers try to predict which products would be most popular and try to advertise those products as much as possible, and also ___________, where algorithms analyze patterns and reveal prerequisites for diseases and suggest preventive treatment, predict the results of various treatments and choose the best option for each patient individually, and predict disease outbreaks and epidemics."
