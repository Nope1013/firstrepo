<h3 id="variables-and-assignments-key-ideas-31">Variables and Assignments Key Ideas (3.1)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Variables are abstractions within programs which represent a value</li>
  <li>Values can be individual data points or a list/collection that contains many data values</li>
  <li>Types of data can include numbers, Booleans (true or false), lists, and strings</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="data-abstraction-key-ideas-32">Data Abstraction Key Ideas (3.2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A list is made up of elements organized in a specific order</li>
  <li>An element is a unique, individual value in a list</li>
  <li>A string differs from a list as it is a sequence of characters rather than elements</li>
  <li>Data abstraction uses a list by taking specific data elements from a list and organizing into a whole, less complex representation of the values such as a table</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To define a variable in Python, type in the variable name (one word) and use the = sign to set it equal to its value</li>
  <li>Can be defined using numbers, string, list, or boolean</li>
  <li>Strings must have quotations “” around it and lists must be surrounded by square brackets []</li>
  <li>THe variable can now be used in functions such as print(‘’)</li>
  <li>A dictionary can be created with keys and values in curly brackets {}</li>
  <li>Variables can be interchanged with temporary variables (temp function)</li>
  <li>They can also be defined with float data type which is used the same as integer</li>
</ul>
