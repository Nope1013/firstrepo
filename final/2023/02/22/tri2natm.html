<p>Our group was pleased with the way that our program was functioning, and looked forward to demonstrating it to an audience. We also showcased our individual features.</p>

<p>We were lucky to have some parents who were interested in our program and they remarked that it was user friendly. The appearance was enjoyed as well. I could definitely improve the Functionality of the program to have it represent my original idea. I want to add a table as well, likely a form, where users can input materials.</p>

<p>Several classmates and students from other classes tried out our project.</p>

<p>We also visited Mr Mort’s period 3 class to see their projects.</p>

<p>I decided to look at the performing and visual arts that were present as well. I revisited the AP Studio Art classroom and was pleasantly surprised to see one of my old pieces. I also looked at digital media, 3-D animation, ceramics, and jazz band.</p>

<p>Overall, N@TM was quite successful and I was glad that we had such a cohesive team. Over break I want to implement the changes I mentioned earlier, and add a table where users can input whether or not they liked their recipe. I will have it store data similar to the local storage button I included.</p>
