| Vocab       | Pseudocode  | Python      | Definition/Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------         |
| input       | DISPLAY(expression)       | print(expression, end=” “)            | Displays the value of expression, followed by a space. Python defaults to newline, thus the end=” “                   |
| output      | a ← INPUT()	| a = input(prompt)	| Accepts a value from the user and returns it to the variable a |
| selection | IF (expression) | if expression: | run commands in the code block associated with the selection         |
| iteration expression   | a ← expression REPEAT UNTIL (expression) | while expression: | Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration while expression is true       |
| iteration n times      | REPEAT n TIMES | for i in range(n): | Repeat commands in the code block associated withe the iteration n times |
| list assignment      | list ← [expression1, expression2, expression3]	| list = [expression1, expression2, expression3]	| Assigns 3 values to list, value can be literal or expressions |
| first index in list      | list[1] |	list[0] |	Access the 1st element in the list[]. FYI, most programming languages start at zero |
| last index in list      | list[LENGTH(list)] | list[len(list) - 1] | Access the last element in the list[]. If you start at zero, last element is length - 1. |
| define procedure     | PROCEDURE name (parameter) | def name(parameter): | Create a procedure containing a sequence of programming instructions |
| expression equals     | a = b | a == b | Evaluate if assigned value of a equals assigned value of b |
| expression does not equal     | a ≠ b | a != b | Evaluate if assigned value of a is NOT equal to assigned value of b |

| Github     | -        | -           | The defacto hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere in the world. Think of it as the **Google Docs for Coders.**                   |
| Visual Studio Code      | -        | -            | Allows you to Edit files, Build your Code, and Pull/Push Code from and to the GitHub                   |
| Jupyter Notebooks     | - | - | A document format for creating and sharing computational documents. These documents allow you to compute segments of Python or Java code as you are taking notes. **(.ipynb**|
| print     | - | print() | Prints a message through Python |
| sequence    | - | - | Two or more lines of code |
| List | - | square brackets [] | A way of grouping data in an ordered sequence, and will be a big part of the requirement for the College Board Create Task project |
| Dictionary | - | curly braces {} | A way of grouping data into in key-value relationships |
